}","We propose fill-in-the-blanks as a video understanding evaluation framework. The task tests a model's understanding of a video by requiring the model to predict a masked noun phrase in the caption of the video, given the video and the surrounding text. To this end, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of 28,000 videos and fill-in-the-blank tests with multiple correct answers. The task and the dataset are challenging for the current state-of-the-art systems to solve. This task also does not share the weaknesses of the current state of the art language-informed video understanding tasks, namely: (1) video question answering using multiple-choice questions, where models perform relatively well because they exploit linguistic biases in the task formulation; and (2) video captioning, which relies on an open-ended evaluation framework that is often inaccurate because system answers may be perceived as incorrect if they differ in form from the ground truth.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","In multimodal machine learning, additive latefusion is a straightforward approach to combine the feature representations from different modalities, in which the final prediction can be formulated as the sum of unimodal predictions. While it has been found that certain late-fusion models can achieve competitive performance with lower computational costs compared to complex multimodal interactive models, how to effectively search for a good late-fusion model is still an open question. Moreover, for different modalities, the best unimodal models may work under significantly different learning rates due to the nature of the modality and the computational flow of the model; thus, selecting a global learning rate for late-fusion models can result in a vanishing gradient for some modalities. To help address these issues, we propose a Modality-Specific Learning Rate (MSLR) method to effectively build late-fusion multimodal models from fine-tuned unimodal models. We investigate three different strategies to assign learning rates to different modalities. Our experiments show that MSLR outperforms global learning rates on multiple tasks and settings, and enables the models to effectively learn each modality.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

While this idea has led to fruitful developments in the field of causal inference, it is not widely-known in the NLP community. In this work, we argue that the causal direction of the data collection process bears nontrivial implications that can explain a number of published NLP findings, such as differences in semi-supervised learning (SSL) and domain adaptation (DA) performance across different settings. We categorize common NLP tasks according to their causal direction and empirically assay the validity of the ICM principle for text data using minimum description length. We conduct an extensive meta-analysis of over 100 published SSL and 30 DA studies, and find that the results are consistent with our expectations based on causal insights.

However, the current literature mostly considers textual content while assessing the quality of an argument, and is limited to datasets containing short sequences (18-48 words). In this paper, we study argument quality assessment in a multimodal context, and experiment on DBATES, a publicly available dataset of long debate videos. First, we propose a set of interpretable debate-centric features such as clarity, content variation, body movement cues, and pauses, inspired by theories of argumentation quality. Second, we design the Multimodal ARgument Quality assessor (MARQ) – a hierarchical neural network model that summarizes the multimodal signals on long sequences and enriches the multimodal embedding with debate-centric features. Our proposed MARQ model achieves an accuracy of 81.91% on the argument quality prediction task and outperforms established baseline models with an error rate reduction of 22.7%.

We introduce a micromodel architecture to address these challenges. Our approach allows researchers to build interpretable representations that embed domain knowledge and provide explanations throughout the model's decision process.

This work seeks to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health by examining how discussions on mental health subreddits have changed in the three months following the WHO’s declaration of a global pandemic. First, the rate at which the pandemic is discussed in each community is quantified. Then, volume of activity is measured to determine whether the number of people with mental health concerns has risen, and user interactions are analyzed to determine how they have changed during the pandemic. Finally, the content of the discussions is analyzed. Each of these metrics is considered with respect to a set of control subreddits to better understand if the changes present are specific to mental health subreddits or are representative of Reddit as a whole. There are numerous changes in the three mental health subreddits that we consider, r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/SuicideWatch; there is reduced posting activity in most cases, and there are significant changes in discussion of some topics such as work and anxiety.

}","Work to date on language-informed video understanding has primarily addressed two tasks: (1) video question answering using multiple-choice questions, where models perform relatively well because they exploit the fact that candidate answers are readily available; and (2) video captioning, which relies on an open-ended evaluation framework that is often inaccurate because system answers may be perceived as incorrect if they differ in form from the ground truth. In this paper, we propose fill-in-the-blanks as a video understanding evaluation framework that addresses these previous evaluation drawbacks, and more closely reflects real-life settings where no multiple choices are given. The task tests a system understanding of a video by requiring the model to predict a masked noun phrase in the caption of the video, given the video and the surrounding text. We introduce a novel dataset consisting of 28,000 videos and fill-in-the-blank tests. We show that both a multimodal model and a strong language model have a large gap with human performance, thus suggesting that the task is more challenging than current video understanding benchmarks.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

In this paper, we discuss claim matching as a possible solution to scale fact-checking. We define claim matching as the task of identifying pairs of textual messages containing claims that can be served with one fact-check. We construct a novel dataset of WhatsApp tipline and public group messages alongside fact-checked claims that are first annotated for containing ""claim-like statements"" and then matched with potentially similar items and annotated for claim matching. Our dataset contains content in high-resource (English, Hindi) and lower-resource (Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil) languages. We train our own embedding model using knowledge distillation and a high-quality ""teacher"" model in order to address the imbalance in embedding quality between the low- and high-resource languages in our dataset. We provide evaluations on the performance of our solution and compare with baselines and existing state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models, namely LASER and LaBSE.

In recent years, a number of approaches have been proposed for various utterance-level dialogue understanding tasks. Most of these approaches account for the context for effective understanding. In this paper, we explore and quantify the role of context for different aspects of a dialogue, namely emotion, intent, and dialogue act identification, using state-of-the-art dialog understanding methods as baselines. Specifically, we employ various perturbations to distort the context of a given utterance and study its impact on the different tasks and baselines.

Extracting such rich explanations from conversations can be conducive to improving several downstream applications. The annotated triplets are categorized by the type of commonsense knowledge present (e.g., causal, conditional, temporal).

In this paper, we investigate a new dataset consisting of the writings of people who manifest intention to change, some of whom persist while others do not. Using a variety of linguistic analysis techniques, we first examine the writing patterns that distinguish the two groups of people. Persistent people tend to reference more topics related to long-term self-improvement and use a more complicated writing style.

}","Word embeddings are usually derived from corpora containing text from many individuals, thus leading to general purpose representations rather than individually personalized representations. While personalized embeddings can be useful to improve language model performance and other language processing tasks, they can only be computed for people with a large amount of longitudinal data, which is not the case for new users.

}","Many NLP applications, such as biomedical data and technical support, have 10-100 million tokens of in-domain data and limited computational resources for learning from it. How should we train a language model in this scenario? Most language modeling research considers either a small dataset with a closed vocabulary (like the standard 1 million token Penn Treebank), or the whole web with byte-pair encoding. We show that for our target setting in English, initialising and freezing input embeddings using in-domain data can improve language model performance by providing a useful representation of rare words, and this pattern holds across several different domains. In the process, we show that the standard convention of tying input and output embeddings does not improve perplexity when initializing with embeddings trained on in-domain data.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

First, we quantify the rate at which COVID-19 is discussed in each community, or subreddit, in order to understand levels of preoccupation with the pandemic.

}","Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to detect and classify sentiment expressed in multimodal data. Research to date has focused on datasets with a large number of training samples, manual transcriptions, and nearly-balanced sentiment labels. However, data collection in real settings often leads to small datasets with noisy transcriptions and imbalanced label distributions, which are therefore significantly more challenging than in controlled settings. In this work, we introduce MORSE, a domain-specific dataset for MultimOdal sentiment analysis in Real-life SEttings. The dataset consists of 2,787 video clips extracted from 49 interviews with panelists in a product usage study, with each clip annotated for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The characteristics of MORSE include noisy transcriptions from raw videos, naturally imbalanced label distribution, and scarcity of minority labels. To address the challenging real-life settings in MORSE, we propose a novel two-step fine-tuning method for multimodal sentiment classification using transfer learning and the Transformer model architecture; our method starts with a pre-trained language model and one step of fine-tuning on the language modality, followed by the second step of joint fine-tuning that incorporates the visual and audio modalities. Experimental results show that while MORSE is challenging for various baseline models such as SVM and Transformer, our two-step fine-tuning method is able to capture the dataset characteristics and effectively address the challenges. Our method outperforms related work that uses both single and multiple modalities in the same transfer learning settings.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

We explore the use of verbal and non-verbal modalities to build a multimodal deception detection system that aims to discriminate between truthful and deceptive statements provided by defendants and witnesses. In particular, three complementary modalities (visual, acoustic and linguistic) are evaluated for the classification of deception at the subject level. The final classifier is obtained by combining the three modalities via score-level classification, achieving 83.05% accuracy in subject-level deceit detection. To place our results in perspective, we present a human deception detection study where we evaluate the human capability of detecting deception using different modalities and compare the results to the developed system.

}","Conversations between patients and providers in clinical settings provide a source of natural language data that may reflect and correlate with the patients’ experience and response to the treatment they are receiving. When analyzing utterances in such conversations, it is not sufficient to consider each sentence in isolation, since its context may play a role in determining its semantic meaning. Recently, contextual information in natural language documents has been modeled using various techniques, such as recurrent neural networks with latent variables, or neural networks with attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present UnsuPerviSed conText AuGmEntation (Upstage), a classification framework that relies on both local and global contextual information from different sources.  Upstage uses transformer models with pretrained language models and joint sentence representation to solve the task of classifying health topics in patient-provider conversations.
In addition, Upstage leverages unlabeled corpora for pretraining and data augmentation to provide additional context, which leads to improved classification performance.

}","Stories are one of the main tools that humans use to make sense of the world around them. This ability is conjectured to be uniquely human, and concepts of agency and interaction have been found to develop during childhood. However, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models still find it very challenging to represent or understand such information about the world. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of research into building systems that can understand the contents of images, videos, and text. Despite several advances made, computers still struggle to understand high-level discourse structures or how visuals and language are organized to tell a coherent story. Recently, several efforts have been made towards building story understanding benchmarks. As characters are the key component around which the story events unfold, character representations are crucial for deep story understanding such as their names, appearances, and relations to other characters. As a step towards endowing systems with a richer understanding of characters in a given narrative, this thesis develops new techniques that rely on the vision, audio and language channels to address three important challenges: i) speaker recognition and identification, ii) character representation and embedding, and iii) temporal modeling of character relations. We propose a multi-modal unsupervised model for speaker naming in movies, a novel way to represent movie character names in dialogues, and a multi-modal supervised character relation classification model. We also show that our approach improves systems ability to understand narratives, which is measured using several tasks such as their ability to answer questions about stories on several benchmarks.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","The underlying traits of our demographic group affect and shape our thoughts, and therefore surface in the way we express ourselves and employ language in our day-to-day life. Understanding and analyzing language use in people from different demographic backgrounds help uncover their demographic particularities. Conversely, leveraging these differences could lead to the development of better language representations, thus enabling further demographic-focused refinements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this thesis, I employ methods rooted in computational linguistics to better understand various demographic groups through their language use. The thesis makes two main contributions.
</br>First, it provides empirical evidence that words are indeed used differently by different demographic groups in naturally occurring text. Through experiments conducted on large datasets which display usage scenarios for hundreds of frequent words, I show that automatic classification methods can be effective in distinguishing between word usages of different demographic groups. I compare the encoding ability of the utilized features by conducting feature analyses, and shed light on how various attributes contribute to highlighting the differences.
</br>Second, the thesis explores whether demographic differences in word usage by different groups can inform the development of more refined approaches to NLP tasks. Specifically, I start by investigating the task of word association prediction. The thesis shows that going beyond the traditional ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, demographic-aware models achieve better performances in predicting word associations for different demographic groups than generic ones. Next, I investigate the impact of demographic information on part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing, and the experiments reveal numerous part-of-speech tags and syntactic relations, whose predictions benefit from the prevalence of a specific group in the training data. Finally, I explore demographic-specific humor generation, and develop a humor generation framework to fill-in the blanks to generate funny stories, while taking into account people’s demographic backgrounds.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

In addition to investigating how personal values are expressed in language, we use natural language processing methods to automatically discover relationships between a person's values, behaviors, and cultural background. To this end, we show that the automatic analysis of less constrained, open-ended essay questions leads to a model of personal values that is more strongly connected to behaviors than traditional forced-choice value surveys, and that cultural background has a significant influence these connections. To help measure personal values in textual data, we use a novel crowd-powered sorting algorithm to construct a hierarchical lexicon of words and phrases related to human values.

We investigate how keyword extraction can be formulated on social media data, such as emails, product reviews, student discussions, and student statements of purpose. We design novel graph-based features for supervised and unsupervised keyword extraction from emails, and use the resulting system with success to uncover patterns in a new dataset -- student statements of purpose. Furthermore, the system is used with new features on the problem of usage expression extraction from product reviews, where we obtain interesting insights. The system while used on student discussions, uncover new and exciting patterns. While each of the above problems is conceptually distinct, they share two key common elements -- keywords and social data. Social data can be messy, hard-to-interpret, and not easily amenable to existing NLP resources. We show that our system is robust enough in the face of such challenges to discover useful and important patterns. We also show that the problem definition of keyword extraction itself can be expanded to accommodate new and challenging research questions and datasets.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

In this work, we study the relationship between MHCI scores and the online expression of mental health symptoms by extracting relevant linguistic features from user-generated content and conducting statistical analyses. Additionally, we build a classifier to predict whether or not a user’s contributions to mental health sub-reddits will increase or decrease.

This work explores the possibility of enhancing such systems with physiological cues obtained from thermography and physiological sensor readings. Using a multimodal dataset consisting of audiovisual, thermal, and physiological recordings of males and females, we extract features from five different modalities, namely acoustic, linguistic, visual, thermal, and physiological. We then conduct a set of experiments where we explore the gender prediction task using single and combined modalities. Experimental results suggest that physiological and thermal information can be used to recognize gender at reasonable accuracy levels, which are comparable to the accuracy of current gender prediction systems. Furthermore, we show that the use of non-contact physiological measurements, such as thermography readings, can enhance current systems that are based on audio or visual input. This can be particularly useful for scenarios where non-contact approaches are preferred, i.e., when data is captured under noisy audiovisual conditions or when video or speech data are not available due to ethical considerations.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","In this paper we introduce a new approach to phrase localization: grounding phrases in sentences to image regions. We propose a structured matching of phrases and regions that encourages the semantic relations between phrases to agree with the visual relations between regions. We formulate structured matching as a discrete optimization problem and relax it to a linear program. We use neural networks to embed regions and phrases into vectors, which then define the similarities (matching weights) between regions and phrases. We integrate structured matching with neural networks to enable end-to-end training. Experiments on Flickr30K Entities demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

To do this, we employ a topic modeling approach to quantify open-ended writing responses describing personal values and everyday behaviors in two distinct cultures. We show that some topics are more prominent in one culture compared to the other, while other topics are mentioned to similar degrees.

Among all available modalities, we focus on three modalities namely, language use, physiological response, and thermal sensing. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate these specific modalities to detect deceit. Several experiments are carried out in which we first select representative features for each modality, and then we analyze joint models that integrate several modalities. The experimental results show that the combination of features from different modalities significantly improves the detection of deceptive behaviors as compared to the use of one modality at a time. Moreover, the use of non-contact modalities proved to be comparable with and sometimes better than existing contact-based methods. The proposed method increases the efficiency of detecting deceit by avoiding human involvement in an attempt to move towards a completely automated non-invasive deception detection process.

In this paper, we seek to explore whether senses aligned across languages exhibit this trait consistently, and if this is the case, we investigate how this property can be leveraged in an automatic fashion. We first conduct a manual annotation study to gauge whether the subjectivity trait of a sense can be robustly transferred across language boundaries. An automatic framework is then introduced that is able to predict subjectivity labeling for unseen senses using either cross-lingual or multilingual training enhanced with bootstrapping.

Furthermore, the entire system is trained without any manually labeled examples – a diverse set of distantly labeled training examples for IS-A relation classification is extracted automatically from list pages and revision histories. We describe a rich set of feature representations that are derived from salient Wikipedia structures, as well as from syntactic and semantic processings of text. A bootstrapped version of the system is used to create additional features for itself, leading to improvements in extraction accuracy. The taxonomic relation extraction system is applied on the Wikipedia category graph and the results are stored in a graph database, with associated confidence levels that allow trading off recall vs. precision. Because it depends exclusively on Wikipedia and requires no manual labeling, the extraction system will be straightforward to update with newer versions of Wikipedia.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

With the recent growth of social websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are emerging as a new source of multimodal and natural opinions that has been left almost untapped by automatic opinion analysis techniques. This paper presents a method for multimodal sentiment classification, which can identify the sentiment expressed in utterance-level visual datastreams. Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed, and that the joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to 10.5% as compared to the best performing individual modality",,,,,,,LIT,TRUE,MOUD: Multimodal Opinion Utterances Dataset,"This is a collection of video reviews, segmented at utterance level, transcribed, and annotated for sentiment.

}","Socrates articulated it best, ""Speak, so I may see you."" Indeed, language represents an invisible probe into the mind. It is the medium through which we express our deepest thoughts, our aspirations, our views, our feelings, our inner reality. From the beginning of artificial intelligence, researchers have sought to impart human like understanding to machines. As much of our language represents a form of self expression, capturing thoughts, beliefs, evaluations, opinions, and emotions which are not available for scrutiny by an outside observer, in the field of natural language, research involving these aspects has crystallized under the name of subjectivity and sentiment analysis. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification further divides subjective text into either positive, negative or neutral. In this thesis, I investigate techniques of generating tools and resources for subjectivity analysis that do not rely on an existing natural language processing infrastructure in a given language. This constraint is motivated by the fact that the vast majority of human languages are scarce from an electronic point of view: they lack basic tools such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, or basic resources such as electronic text, annotated corpora or lexica. This severely limits the implementation of techniques on par with those developed for English, and by applying methods that are lighter in the usage of text processing infrastructure, we are able to conduct multilingual subjectivity research in these languages as well. Since my aim is also to minimize the amount of manual work required to develop lexica or corpora in these languages, the techniques proposed employ a lever approach, where English often acts as the donor language (the fulcrum in a lever) and allows through a relatively minimal amount of effort to establish preliminary subjectivity research in a target language.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

We demonstrate this advantage by incorporating semantic compatibility features for neutral pronouns computed from web n-gram statistics. Experimental results show that the combination of the new features with the expert rules in the adaptive clustering approach results in an overall performance improvement and a substantial 5% improvement in F1 measure for the target pronouns.,,,,,,,MuSeNet,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Subjectivity and sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic identification of private states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations in natural language. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification adds an additional level of granularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral.

While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Romanian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods applied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been looking at the ability of characters to carry sentiment information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of politeness and additional verbal modes embedded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These additional sources of information may not be available across all languages, yet, various articles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectivity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak English (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishes further every year, as more people across the globe gain Internet access.
 </br></br>
The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize the attendees with the subjectivity and sentiment research carried out on languages other than English in order to enable and promote cross-fertilization. Specifically, we will review work along three main directions. First, we will present methods where the resources and tools have been specifically developed for a given target language. In this category, we will also briefly overview the main methods that have been proposed for English, but which can be easily ported to other languages. Second, we will describe cross-lingual approaches, including several methods that have been proposed to leverage on the resources and tools available in English by using cross-lingual projections. Finally, third, we will show how the expression of opinions and polarity pervades language boundaries, and thus methods that holistically explore multiple languages at the same time can be effectively considered.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

One crucial challenge for the coming decade is to be able to harvest relevant information from this constant flow of multimodal data. This paper addresses the task of multimodal sentiment analysis, and conducts proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate that a joint model that integrates visual, audio, and textual features can be effectively used to identify sentiment in Web videos. This paper makes three important contributions. First, it addresses for the first time the task of tri-modal sentiment analysis, and shows that it is a feasible task that can benefit from the joint exploitation of visual, audio and textual modalities. Second, it identifies a subset of audio-visual features relevant to sentiment analysis and present guidelines on how to integrate these features. Finally, it introduces a new dataset consisting of real online data, which will be useful for future research in this area.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

In this paper, we scale up the integration of SWSD into contextual opinion analysis and still obtain improvements in performance, by successfully gathering data annotated by non-expert annotators.

In addition to the identification of entire Web pages, we also propose a new feature specifically designed to find parallel text chunks within a single document. Experiments carried out on the Quechua-Spanish language pair show that the system is successful in automatically identifying a significant amount of parallel texts on the Web. Evaluations of a machine translation system trained on this corpus indicate that the Web-gathered parallel texts can supplement manually compiled parallel texts and perform significantly better than the manually compiled texts when tested on other Web-gathered data.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","Natural Language Processing holds great promise for making computer interfaces that are easier to use for people, since people will (hopefully) be able to talk to the computer in their own language, rather than learn a specialized language of computer commands. For programming, however, the necessity of a formal programming language for communicating with a computer has always been taken for granted. We would like to challenge this assumption. We believe that modern Natural Language Processing techniques can make possible the use of natural language to (at least partially) express programming ideas, thus drastically increasing the accessibility of programming to non-expert users. To demonstrate the feasibility of Natural Language Programming, this paper tackles what are perceived to be some of the hardest cases: steps and loops. We look at a corpus of English descriptions used as programming assignments, and develop some techniques for mapping linguistic constructs onto program structures, which we refer to as programmatic semantics.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

A random walk model is applied on a graph encoding words and co-occurrence dependencies, resulting in scores that represent a quantification of how a particular word feature contributes to a given context. We argue that by modeling feature weights using these scores, as opposed to the traditional frequency-based scores, we can achieve better results in a text classification task. Experiments performed on four standard classification datasets show that the new random-walk based approach outperforms the traditional term frequency approach to feature weighting.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

In this paper, I overview the main lines of research in deriving efficient Word Sense Disambiguation methods that exploit: (1) the Web as a corpus – which represents a view of the Web seen as an enormous collection of Web pages; and (2) the Web as collective mind – where the Web is regarded as a large group of Web users who can contribute their knowledge to the process of identifying word meanings.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

Word and sense properties are extracted using the WordNet lexical database enhanced with Prolog inference rules and a number of lexical transformations. Inference rules are based on navigation in various WordNet relation chains (hypernyms, meronyms, entailment and causality links, etc.) and derived relations expressed as boolean combinations of node and edge properties used to direct the navigation. The resulting <i>abstract story traces</i> provide a compact view of the underlying narrative’s key content elements and a means for automated indexing and classification of text collections. <i>Ontology driven projections</i> act as a kind of ""semantic lenses"" and provide a means to select a subset of a narrative whose key sense elements are subsumed by a set of concepts, predicates and properties expressing the focus of interest of a user. Finally, we discuss applications of these techniques in text understanding, classification of text collections and answering questions about a text.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

}","This paper describes a framework for building <i>story traces</i> (compact global views of a narrative) and <i>story projections</i> (selections of key story elements) and their applications in digital storytelling. Word and sense properties are extracted using the WordNet lexical database enhanced with Prolog inference rules and a number of lexical transformations. Inference rules are based on navigation in various WordNet relation chains (hypernyms, meronyms, entailment and causality links, etc.) and derived inferential closures expressed as boolean combinations of node and edge properties used to direct the navigation. The resulting <i>abstract story traces</i> provide a compact view of the underlying story’s key content elements and a means for automated indexing and classification of story collections [1, 2]. <i>Ontology driven projections</i> act as a kind of ""semantic lenses"" and provide a means to select a subset of a story whose key sense elements are subsumed by a set of concepts, predicates and properties expressing the focus of interest of a user. Finally, we discuss applications of these techniques in story understanding, classification of digital story collections, story generation and story-related question answering. The main contribution of the paper consists in the use of a lexical knowledge base together with an advanced rule based inference mechanism for understanding stories, and the use of the information extracted by this process for various applications.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

This paper introduces the semantic wildcard, one of the most powerful operators implemented in IRSLO, which allows for searches along general-specific lines. The semantic wildcard, denoted with #, acts in a manner similar with the lexical wildcard, but at semantic levels, enabling the retrieval of subsumed concepts. For instance, a search for <i>animal</i># will match any concept that is of type <i>animal</i>, including <i>dog</i>, <i>goat</i> and so forth, thereby going beyond the explicit knowledge stated in texts. This operator, together with a lexical locality operator that enables the retrieval of paragraphs rather than entire documents, have been both implemented in the IRSLO system and tested on requests of information run against an index of 130,000 documents. Significant improvement was observed over classic keyword-based retrieval systems in terms of precision, recall and success rate.",,,,,,,LIT,TRUE,QA Data Set: Annotated Questions,"Annotations for about 5,500 questions used in an analysis of information requests.
