2021,Latent Hatred: A Benchmark for Understanding Implicit Hate Speech,"M. ElSherief*, C. Ziems*, D. Muchlinski, V. Anupindi, J. Seybolt, M. De Choudhury, D. Yang.",EMNLP 2021,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F2109.05322&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0Jv9Ach5EywP23ksdybQBc,"FIB, vision, webd",,,,,"Hate speech has grown significantly on social
media, causing serious consequences for victims of all demographics. Despite much attention being paid to characterize and detect
discriminatory speech, most work has focused
on explicit or overt hate speech, failing to address a more pervasive form based on coded
or indirect language. To fill this gap, this
work introduces a theoretically-justified taxonomy of implicit hate speech and a benchmark
corpus with fine-grained labels for each message and its implication. We present systematic analyses of our dataset using contemporary baselines to detect and explain implicit
hate speech, and we discuss key features that
challenge existing models. This dataset will
continue to serve as a useful benchmark for understanding this multifaceted issue. To download the data, see https://github.com/
